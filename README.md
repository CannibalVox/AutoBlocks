IconTweaks
==========

A cuttable block autodetector like Immibis's Microblocks for ChickenBones's Microblocks.

Important Info
==============

This mod is extremly proof-of-concept. There are some major bugs. I don't even know if it works on all systems. You have been warned.

Known Bugs
==========

* Really odd blokcs (like Levers and Saplings) can be cut.
* Crashes upon attempting to cut up items with missing textures.
* NEI freaks out graphically when attempting to look at some added blocks.
