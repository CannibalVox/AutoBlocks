AutoBlocks
==========

AutoBlocks is a cuttable block autodetector like Immibis's Microblocks for ForgeMultipart.

This mod adds all obpaque cubic blocks (It can be set to all blocks period via config) to the list of possible blocks to cut. It isn't 100% percent perfect, but it's a robust tool to help with expanding ForgeMultipart's functionality.

==========

* Adding/reomving new mods with blocks may upset current microblock placement.
